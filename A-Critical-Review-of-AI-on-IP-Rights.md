**A Critical Review of "Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Intellectual Property Rights"**

**__Niteesh Kumar Upadhyay and Mahak Rathee’s article__**, published in the Proceedings of the International Young Scholars’ Workshop (2020), examines how advances in artificial intelligence (AI) both bolster and unsettle established intellectual property (IP) regimes. Through a close analysis of copyright, patent law, traditional knowledge, and liability principles, the authors argue that AI’s rapid ascent demands a comprehensive legal response to preserve incentives for creativity while accommodating machine-generated innovations.

AI systems have transcended simple computational tools to perform tasks traditionally reserved for human ingenuity. Upadhyay and Rathee  contend that no sector, IP included remains immune to AI’s disruptive potential. They frame their inquiry around a core paradox: AI can accelerate invention and streamline IP administration even as it challenges the very notions of authorship and inventorship that underpin copyright and patent protection.

 AI has a dual-faced” influence on IP. On one hand, machine-learning models enhance patent searches, reduce research timelines, and generate patentable subject matter with unparalleled speed. On the other, this autonomy erodes the human-centric foundations of IP law, creating uncertainty over who—inventors, programmers, or AI agents—should hold exclusive rights.

Challenges in Copyright Authorship, The authors next explore how modern AI systems blur the line between tool and creator. Whereas early software merely supported human authorship, recent generative models produce novel texts, images, and code with minimal human input. This evolution raises pressing questions about the allocation of copyright: should it vest in the AI developer, the end-user who provides prompts, or the AI “agent” itself? Absent clear statutory guidance, disputes are likely to proliferate.

Patent Entitlement Ambiguities, Upadhyay and Rathee then survey domains where AI-driven inventions strain patent law’s traditional contours. They note that autonomous weapon systems could design novel munitions without human oversight, leaving patent entitlement and compliance with international humanitarian law in limbo. In the pharmaceutical sphere, an AI that discovers a vaccine candidate for a global pandemic would force stakeholders to renegotiate manufacturing rights and pricing. Finally, AI-enabled road-safety technologies, such as driver-monitoring algorithms, illustrate how machine-generated improvements can both reduce accidents and spawn complex liability questions.

Risks to Traditional Knowledge, the paper warns that AI systems trained on public databases may appropriate centuries-old community practices collectively termed traditional knowledge without attribution or benefit-sharing. Communities that lack formal IP registrations are particularly vulnerable to unremunerated exploitation, underscoring the need for sui generis protections.

Liability for Infringement When AI infringes existing IP rights, accountability becomes opaque. The paper explain that a programmer who knowingly designs an infringing algorithm bears clear liability. Yet in instances of unintended infringement—where the AI autonomously replicates protected material—it remains unclear whether legal responsibility should attach to the developer, the owner, or the AI system itself. The authors emphasize that current tort and criminal frameworks lack the nuance to address these scenarios.

Upadhyay and Rathee’s analysis merits praise for its comprehensive treatment of multiple IP domains and its use of concrete examples. Their interdisciplinary approach incorporating WIPO reports, EU scholarship, and real-world case studies offers readers a broad view of AI’s implications for IP. However, the article would benefit from empirical data on AI-related litigation trends and from a comparative assessment of how jurisdictions such as the European Union, the United States, and India are adapting their IP statutes. Moreover, while the authors correctly identify legal lacunae, they stop short of proposing detailed legislative or regulatory models to bridge these gaps.

As a conclusion, Upadhyay and Rathee successfully map the tensions between AI’s promise as an innovation catalyst and its capacity to unsettle core IP doctrines. Their call for a “roadmap” of clear definitions, tiered liability rules, and protective measures for traditional knowledge holders is both timely and urgent. As AI continues to evolve, legislators, IP offices, and scholars must collaborate to craft legal frameworks that harness AI’s benefits without sacrificing the incentives and protections that underpin creative and inventive activity.
