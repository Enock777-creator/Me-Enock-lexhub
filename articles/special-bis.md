Understanding 'Special' and 'Bis' in Law Drafting: Tools for Precision and Agility in Legislation

The process of drafting and enacting laws is meticulous, aiming for clarity, coherence, and effectiveness. Legal drafters employ various linguistic and structural tools to achieve these goals, and among them, the terms "Special" and "Bis" hold specific, though sometimes misunderstood, significance. These concepts are crucial for adding precision, addressing unique circumstances, and maintaining the structural integrity of legal texts.


Dissecting 'Special' in Law Drafting
The initial premise that "Special laws are passed urgently or exceptionally, outside regular legislative sessions" is largely inaccurate in a general legal context. While some laws might be enacted quickly, the term "special law" has a much more precise and foundational meaning in legal systems, particularly those influenced by civil law traditions or where constitutional frameworks differentiate types of legislation.

In law drafting, **a Special Law**typically refers to a law that:

Addresses a Specific Subject Matter or Group: Unlike "general laws" which apply broadly to all persons or situations within a jurisdiction, a special law is designed to regulate a particular subject, a specific class of persons, or a defined set of circumstances.

Example: A "General Law on Public Health" would cover all aspects of public health for everyone. A "Special Law on the Regulation of Pharmaceuticals" would specifically deal with that narrower field. Similarly, a law establishing a specific public university might be a special law, as opposed to a general law on education.

Derives from a Specific Constitutional Mandate or Exception: Constitutions often differentiate between general laws and special laws. A special law might be required for certain types of legislation, or it might be enacted to provide specific provisions that deviate from or complement a general law without repealing it entirely.

Example: A constitution might require a "special law" passed by a supermajority to create new administrative regions, whereas ordinary laws might only require a simple majority.

Takes Precedence within its Scope: A fundamental principle of legal interpretation is lex specialis derogat legi generali (special law derogates from general law). This means that where a special law and a general law conflict, the special law applies to the specific situation it governs, while the general law continues to apply to all other situations. This ensures that tailor-made solutions can exist without destabilizing broader legal frameworks.

Example: If a General Law on Contracts states that all contracts must be in writing, but a Special Law on E-commerce allows for electronic contracts under specific conditions, the Special Law would apply to e-commerce contracts.

Is Not Necessarily Urgent or Exceptional in Passage: While a law addressing a specific, urgent crisis might be a "special law" by nature of its narrow focus, the term "special law" itself does not inherently imply a rushed legislative process or enactment outside regular sessions. Its "special" nature refers to its scope and relationship to other laws, not its legislative journey. Laws passed urgently are typically designated as such through specific procedural mechanisms (e.g., "emergency legislation," "fast-tracked bills"), not by being labeled "special laws."

Unpacking 'Bis' in Legal Nomenclature
The Latin term "Bis," meaning "twice," is a highly practical and widely used convention in law drafting, particularly in civil law systems or those with highly structured legal codes. Its purpose is purely organizational:

Inserting New Provisions Without Re-numbering: When a new article, section, or paragraph needs to be added between two existing, consecutively numbered provisions (e.g., between Article 5 and Article 6), inserting it as "Article 5 bis" (or 5a, 5.1, etc., depending on the specific legal tradition) allows for the seamless integration of new content without having to re-number every subsequent article in the entire law.

**Example:**

Original Law:

Article 4: General principles.

Article 5: Rights of citizens.

Article 6: Duties of citizens.

After adding "Bis" Article:

Article 4: General principles.

Article 5: Rights of citizens.

Article 5 bis: Additional rights for vulnerable groups.

Article 6: Duties of citizens.

Maintaining Structural Coherence: This method preserves the original numbering logic and makes it easier for legal professionals to cross-reference and navigate large statutory instruments. Imagine trying to update references in hundreds of related laws every time a new article was added! "Bis" avoids this monumental task.

**Indicating Additions Over Time: The presence of "bis," "ter," "quater" (third, fourth, etc., though less common than "bis") articles often indicates that specific provisions have been added or amended after the original drafting of the law, reflecting legislative updates and adaptations to new circumstances.**

The Drafter's Arsenal: Precision and Agility
Legal drafters leverage "special laws" and "bis" articles as essential tools in their craft:

Special Laws: Enable precision by allowing for tailored legal frameworks for specific contexts. They reflect a sophisticated approach to governance, where broad principles are complemented by focused regulations. Their use demonstrates a recognition that "one size fits all" solutions are not always effective and that specific situations require specific legal attention, while maintaining a clear hierarchy and relationship with general laws.

"Bis" Articles: Are a testament to efficiency and structural integrity in legal codes. They allow for the agile adaptation of existing legislation to new needs, judicial interpretations, or evolving societal demands without disrupting the entire numbering system. This structural flexibility is vital for maintaining up-to-date and easily navigable legal frameworks, which is crucial for legal certainty and accessibility.

**In conclusion, a clear understanding of "special laws" and the "bis" convention reveals how legal drafting is a dynamic and precise discipline. These tools are not merely linguistic quirks but fundamental mechanisms that allow legal systems to be both comprehensive in their scope and adaptable in their application, ensuring that laws remain relevant and effective in a constantly changing world.**

**“Special”** laws are passed urgently or exceptionally, outside regular legislative sessions.

**“Bis”** (Latin: “twice”) is used to insert extra articles—like “Article 5 bis”—between existing numbered provisions, without altering the rest of the law’s structure.

Legal drafters use these tools to add precision and urgency to statutory language.
