**What Is Judicial Precedent?**

Date: 11 July, 2025

Judicial precedent means using previous court rulings as guidance in current legal decisions. It provides consistency and predictability across the justice system.

Judicial precedent, or stare decisis, is a doctrine where courts follow legal principles set by prior decisions. In Rwanda’s evolving legal system—which blends civil law traditions with increasing common law influence—precedent plays an increasingly important role.

Historically, civil law systems like Rwanda’s did not consider case law as a binding source. However, Rwanda now recognizes Supreme Court decisions as binding on all lower courts, while judgments from other courts are only persuasive.

The article highlights how binding precedents provide consistency, fairness, and legal certainty, but also warns of problems like contradictory Supreme Court decisions, which create confusion and threaten legal stability (insécurité juridique).

To address these issues, the author emphasizes:

The importance of harmonizing judicial practice across all courts.

The criteria for a decision to become precedent, such as whether it settled a legal question and is frequently cited.

The need to prioritize recent and specific decisions when contradictions arise (the principle of posteriority and specificity).

The potential for lower courts to rely on persuasive decisions from other Rwandan courts if a Supreme Court ruling seems unjust or outdated.

Ultimately, judicial precedent in Rwanda is gaining ground as a tool for promoting coherent and just legal interpretation. However, the author calls for clearer guidelines, consistent law reporting, and stronger oversight from the Supreme Court to avoid conflicting rulings and protect parties’ rights.
