**What Is Judicial Precedent?**

Date: 11 July, 2025

Judicial precedent means using previous court rulings as guidance in current legal decisions. It provides consistency and predictability across the justice system.

Judicial precedent, or stare decisis, is a doctrine where courts follow legal principles set by prior decisions. In Rwandaâ€™s evolving legal systemâ€”which blends civil law traditions with increasing common law influenceâ€”precedent plays an increasingly important role.

Historically, civil law systems like Rwandaâ€™s did not consider case law as a binding source. However, Rwanda now recognizes Supreme Court decisions as binding on all lower courts, while judgments from other courts are only persuasive.

The article highlights how binding precedents provide consistency, fairness, and legal certainty, but also warns of problems like contradictory Supreme Court decisions, which create confusion and threaten legal stability (insÃ©curitÃ© juridique).

To address these issues, the author emphasizes:

The importance of harmonizing judicial practice across all courts.

The criteria for a decision to become precedent, such as whether it settled a legal question and is frequently cited.

The need to prioritize recent and specific decisions when contradictions arise (the principle of posteriority and specificity).

The potential for lower courts to rely on persuasive decisions from other Rwandan courts if a Supreme Court ruling seems unjust or outdated.

Ultimately, judicial precedent in Rwanda is gaining ground as a tool for promoting coherent and just legal interpretation. However, the author calls for clearer guidelines, consistent law reporting, and stronger oversight from the Supreme Court to avoid conflicting rulings and protect partiesâ€™ rights.

Logic and the Law by MUGISHA Enock

Legal reasoning blends logical rules with judgment and real-world complexity.

** Judicial Decision-Making and Logical Reasoning**

Judicial reasoning is often thought to be a purely logical processâ€”applying laws to facts to reach predictable conclusions. While logic plays a role, real judicial decision-making is much more complex and influenced by many factors.

Three main types of logical reasoning are relevant to how judges make decisions:

Deductive reasoning: This moves from a general rule to a specific conclusion. For example:

All criminal offences are unlawful. Theft is a criminal offence. Therefore, theft is unlawful.

Inductive reasoning: This works in the opposite directionâ€”starting from specific examples to form a general rule. For instance, after seeing several Greek philosophers, one might (incorrectly) conclude that all humans are Greek.

Reasoning by analogy: Instead of generalizing, this method compares one case to another similar one. If two fact patterns are alike, they should result in similar judgments.

Logic and the Law Although legal systems may seem to follow strict logical reasoning, legal interpretation is rarely so straightforward. Statutory interpretation and precedent appear deductive but often involve subjective choices, such as:

Selecting which precedent to apply,

Deciding which facts are similar enough,

Or identifying which legal principle takes priority.

This makes common law a more inductive system, where principles evolve from the accumulation of similar cases.

To wrap it up, Judges do rely on logicâ€”but they also make interpretative choices that involve morality, policy, politics, and social context. Court decisions often appear strictly legal and objective, but in reality, they reflect a blend of logical argument and deeper human judgment. Recognizing this helps us understand why similar cases may lead to different outcomes, and why legal reasoning is both an art and a science.

**How Precedents Really Work**

Common law grows inductively from many cases
Judges use analogy more than strict deduction
ðŸ§  **Reasoning the Law**
Statutes and decisions require interpretation
Morality, politics, and economics influence judgments
Legal arguments persuade; they donâ€™t just compute

**Law isnâ€™t just logicâ€”itâ€™s thoughtful navigation of principles and people.*
