Legal reasoning blends logical rules with judgment and real-world complexity.

### ⚖️ How Precedents Really Work
- Common law grows inductively from many cases
- Judges use analogy more than strict deduction

### 🧠 Reasoning the Law
- Statutes and decisions require interpretation
- Morality, politics, and economics influence judgments
- Legal arguments persuade; they don’t just compute

Law isn’t just logic—it’s thoughtful navigation of principles and people.
